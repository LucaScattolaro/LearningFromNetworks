# What	are	the	Motifs	in	Our	Favorite	Social	Network?	

## Motivation:		
• we	want	to	understand	what	motifs	are	more	surprising	in	
our	favorite	social	network	
• Data:	these	networks	from	publicly	available	datasets	
[DETAILS]	
Method:	
• Problem:	compute	the	motifs	for	the	network	[DETAILS]	
• Algorithms:		[DETAILS]	
Intended	experiments:	
• we	will	use	the	implementations	available	at	[URL]		
[DETAILS]	
• machine	for	experiments:	[DETAILS]	
• experiments:	compute	motifs;	try	to	understand	what	
these	motifs	represent	[DETAILS]
