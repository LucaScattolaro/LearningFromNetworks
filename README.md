# Project_Proposal
## Finding significant Nodes in Twitch network with Node Features and find important motifs.
**Motivation**
- We want to find the most influent people in this Social Network: It is an important aspect usefull for marketing, society and so on...
- We want	to understand	what motifs	are	more surprising	in Twitch
**Data**
- We are going to use this network:
  - https://snap.stanford.edu/data/twitch_gamers.html with:
      - Nodes	168,114
      - Edges	6,797,557


**Method**	
- Problem:	compute	the	centrality	scores	for	all	nodes	in	a	PPI	
  - Algorithms:	we	are	going	to	try	to	use	an	exact	algorithm and also different approximations such as:
    - Algorithm 1
    - Algorithm 2
    - ...
    in Order to find a good trade-off between computational time and error.
    
- Problem:	compute	the	motifs	for	the	network:
  - Algorithms: ones that we will see during the course

**Baseline and Machines**:	
- We	will	use	the	implementations	available	at	[URL].	It	provides exact	methods	and	approximate	methods	and we will modify it to calculate the approximations
- Machines	for	experiments: We are going to use different machines due to avalability:
  - PC1: (Luca) 
  - PC2: (Alessandro)
  - PC3: (Alberto)
  - PC4: (Lavoro Luca)

**Experiments**:	
  - compute	centralities	on	the	data and create a rank	
  - compute	motifs and try to understand what these	motifs represent
